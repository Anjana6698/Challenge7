        <h1>About Us Page</h1>
        <p>In 1985, Mr.Tajudeen (Mr. Taj) decided to open the first branch called ‘NEW TAJ’ in the centre of Kuantan, Pahang. In the beginning, we started with very few dishes and our ‘Nasi Briyani’’ and ‘Kari Kepala Ikan’ gained popularity in a short period of time.</p>
        <p>Since the response from the locals was overwhelming, we opened our second branch right behind New Taj in 1996. Moreover, receiving ‘The Best Restaurant’ Award in the same year has been a good start to our business. Hence, Mr. Taj decided to pursue his Masters of Business Administration (MBA) to enhance his soft skills like adaptive thinking and interpersonal skills.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Mr. Taj has been dedicating all his enthusiasm and efforts in order to grow the business. He constantly focuses on the quality of food and service and makes sure the dishes are flavoursome before serving his beloved customers. Our ‘Nasi Biryani Ayam’ and ‘Kari Kepala Ikan’ are known as our signature dishes until today. Taj restaurant not only fulfils your cravings but we also cater to your local taste buds.</p>
